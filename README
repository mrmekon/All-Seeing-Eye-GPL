** Summary

All-Seeing Eye is an iOS application for restaurant/bar or other service 
industry companies to use and manage a Customer Loyalty program.  Membership
cards with unique barcodes are distributed to customers, and All-Seeing Eye
is used to scan a customer's card at the POS to determine his or her earned
benefits.

All-Seeing Eye is developed for the Apple iPad 2, but is periodically tested
and expected to function decently on an Apple iPhone or iPod Touch.

All-Seeing Eye uses the ZBar barcode scanning library by Jeff Brown,
which is licensed under the GNU LGPL v2.1.


** User Interface

All-Seeing Eye's user interface is split into two frames: a top frame that
shows a live feed from the iPad/iPhone rear camera, and a bottom frame that
shows customer information retrieved from a database after successfully
scanning a barcode with the camera.


** Customer Administration Interface

An alternate view is available for managing the customer database from within
All-Seeing Eye.  The user enters administration mode by performing a two-
fingered swipe on the screen while at the main interface.

The administration view shows a table with all registered customers, sorted
roughly by last name.  This table has a search bar to rapidly search by
name or barcode.  The administrator can select a customer to view and edit
detailed information, can push a button to add a new customer, or can enter
the edit mode and subsequently delete customers.

The customer detail page is launched by creating a new customer or clicking
on an existing one.  This page shows all of the detailed information stored
in the local database regarding a customer.  This includes things like name,
barcode, contact information, and birth date.  The administrator can view
and edit any of this information using the provided interface.

When finished administering, the simply press the 'done' or 'back' buttons
until you arrive back at the main barcode scanning interface.
