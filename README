** Summary

All-Seeing Eye is an iOS application for restaurant/bar or other service 
industry companies to use and manage a Customer Loyalty program.  Membership
cards with unique barcodes are distributed to customers, and All-Seeing Eye
is used to scan a customer's card at the POS to determine his or her earned
benefits.

All-Seeing Eye is developed for the Apple iPad 2, but is periodically tested
and expected to function decently on an Apple iPhone or iPod Touch.

All-Seeing Eye uses the ZBar barcode scanning library by Jeff Brown,
which is licensed under the GNU LGPL v2.1.


** User Interface

All-Seeing Eye's user interface is split into two frames: a top frame that
shows a live feed from the iPad/iPhone rear camera, and a bottom frame that
shows customer information retrieved from a database after successfully
scanning a barcode with the camera.


** Customer Administration Interface

Not designed yet.
